The source codes provided in this project are my personal work; ST-GCN work by:
https://github.com/yysijie/st-gcn/blob/master/OLD_README.md, ST-GCN and
redistribution of independently developed packages.


- The files stored in the PXA573 file are, or are either contained in PXA573 named folder are my personal work.
- The ST-GCN work was used as the baseline for the deep learning framework and integration, the files we altered so
that we have extra features are the ones stored in the UseInST-GCN. Simply replace the main, and add the pxa573_rec.py
stored in the USEInST-GCN

If you want to pre-process data from MoCap use MainPreprocessor.py in PXA573/preprocessing
If you want to add distortions to data from MoCap use files in PXA573/postprocessing
If you want to turn your data back to c3d format use the homonymous file in backtoc3d

In the codes provided you need to change the directories required.

If you want to download our benchmarks or use our data for training:
- download data: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YNgApnmZqXGQNHL1WLXyhZRSbzr-aq1V

If you simply want to run our benchmarks using the ST-GCN:

- Clone the https://github.com/yysijie/st-gcn/blob/master/OLD_README.md project, ST-GCN and follow their instructions
- assign the appropriate directories and weights in the /config/st_gcn/xx/test.yaml files
- run the command 'python main.py pxa573rec -c config/st_gcn/< fill >/test.yaml'
* In the empty to fill space write ntu-xview or ntu-xsub with regard to which model you want to test
 
Feel free to use the code and data, if you have any queries contact me at: Papachrist@outlook.com
